```
$ kubectl exec pod/py-app-python-0 -- cat /app/data/visits
101
$ kubectl exec pod/py-app-python-1 -- cat /app/data/visits
36
```

The first pod received more visits than the second one. This difference is
probably because `minikube service` mostly proxied requests to the first pod,
and the second pod only got healthcheck requests. If there was a load balance,
perhaps the numbers were more equal.

### Ordering guarantees

Ordering guarantees are not needed for my app because each pod is independent of
others. Hence, we can start as many pods as we want in parallel.

## Bonus task: update strategies

There are two strategies for updating pods: `RollingUpdate` and `OnDelete`.

In `RollingUpdate`, pods start to update one-by-one right after patching the
`StatefulSet`. It is possible to control the number of updated pods with the
`partiton` property to allow canary deployments.

With `OnDelete`, patching a `StatefulSet` does not update any pods on its own
but requires further manual action: a pod will update when you delete it and the
`StatefulSet` tries to restore this pod.
