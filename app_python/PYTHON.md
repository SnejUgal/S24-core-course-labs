# Python Web Application

## Rationale for the web framework

I chose the `aiohttp` web framework for these reasons:

- It is a popular and well-maintained web framework;
- It is built upon async Python;
- It is simple and light-weight, compared to frameworks such as Django.

## Best practices

In my web app, I used these best practices:

- I created a virtual environment to isolate installed packages for my app;
- I used type annotations to ensure that the code is correct.

In addition, I formatted my code using `black` and ran `pylint` to find any
potential problem in my code.

## Testing

So far, I tested my web application manually using `curl`.
